        <h1>How to create a website</h1>
        <h3>author Tanim</h3>
        <p>Step 1: Get a domain name and URL
            It's important to choose a good domain name. It affects:
            
            how easily customers can find your site
            how much customers will trust your website and brand
            your intellectual property and trademark protection.

            Understand domain names and URLs
            
            Keep it consistent with your brand
            
            Make it easy to remember
            
            Check the availability of social handles and domain names
            
            Decide on a domain name extension
            
            Buy your domain name
            Remember to renew
            Set up a reminder to renew your domain names and security certificates on time.
            
            Read more about the risks of abandoned domain names.
            
            Step 2: Set up an email address to match your domain name
            You can use free email services for your business, but using one that matches your domain (and business) name, creates a more professional impression.
            
            For example, your domain-name email will display as info@mybusiness.com, instead of mybusiness@gmail.com.
            
            The service provider who registers your domain name, or your web hosting company, may provide an email service or include it as a paid add-on.
            
            Step 3: Find a web hosting company
            For your website to be published and accessible on the internet, it has to be hosted by a web hosting company. These companies provide you with a secure space on their server to store all your website content.
            
            You can host your website with the same company you register your domain name with, or you can choose a different host if this meets your business needs better.
            
            Monthly fees for web hosting can vary depending on how big your website is and how many visits you get.

            Step 4: Design your website
            When designing your website, think about:
            
            the information you want to give your customers
            what you want them to do on your site
            the questions they'll have
            the order they'll be doing things in.
            Structure the site to make it easy for them to find and do the things they need. It might help to look at websites of businesses like yours to see how they've designed their site and what features they've added.
            
            A well-designed and easy-to-use website will help your business stand out.
            
            An easy way to understand what you may need for your website is to draw up a visual site map.
            
            Typically, you'd want a page dedicated to each product range or critical service you offer.
            
            Quick reference: Create a visual site map
            An easy way to understand what you may need for your website is to draw up a visual site map. See our example of a site map (JPG, 140KB).
            
            This example will show you how a visual map can:
            
            show the layout of every page on your proposed website and how these pages link together
            give a clear overall picture of the website's scope
            help you decide if it will be easy to create it yourself or if a web developer may be a better option.

            Step 5: Build your website
            When deciding how to build your website, consider how it will be maintained and how easy it will be to make changes. You might need to make regular changes to the content on your website, for example:
            
            updating advertising and adding information on sales and special offers
            updating contact information
            reflecting changes in prices, products and services
            updating opening times, for example, for public holidays
            changing the look and feel of your website.
            Building your website can be a do-it-yourself (DIY) or do-it-for-me (DIFM) project. You can create your business website by:
            
            using a template-based website builder (DIY)
            using a CMS to build a customised website (DIY or DIFM)
            hiring a professional web developer (DIFM).
            Considering the advantages and disadvantages of each option will help you decide which one will work best for you.</p>
